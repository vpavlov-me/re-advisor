## 📋 Working with Epics and Sprints

### Understanding Epics
An **Epic** is a large feature that takes several sprints to complete. It contains:
- **Business Objectives:** Why we're building this
- **User Stories:** Who will use it and how
- **Acceptance Criteria:** How we know it's done
- **Success Metrics:** How we measure success

### Sprint Planning
Every 2 weeks, we plan a new sprint:
1. **Review completed work** from last sprint
2. **Plan new work** for upcoming sprint
3. **Identify blockers** and dependencies
4. **Set sprint goals** and priorities

### Your Role in Planning
- **Define requirements** - What should the feature do?
- **Write user stories** - Who will use it and why?
- **Set acceptance criteria** - How do we know it's done?
- **Prioritize features** - What's most important?

## 🎯 Current Epic: Adviser Registration

### Business Context
**Problem:** Families want access to professional financial advisers, but we don't have a way for advisers to join our platform.

**Solution:** Build registration and profile management for external advisers.

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Advisers can register themselves
- [ ] Advisers can manage their profiles  
- [ ] Families can find and connect with advisers
- [ ] Platform maintains compliance and security

### Your Next Actions
1. **Review:** `project-management/epics/epic-003/README.md`
2. **Check:** Current sprint progress in `project-management/sprints/current/`
3. **Add:** Any missing requirements or concerns as GitHub Issues
4. **Test:** Once features are built, validate they meet business needs
