- Addresses ethical issues directly even when uncomfortable
- Others describe them as trustworthy and someone who 'does the right thing'
- **Example:** "When family member requested special treatment violating company policy, respectfully declined and explained rationale; family accepted decision as maintaining important principle"

**3 - ADEQUATE (Needs Development)**
- Generally ethical but occasionally takes expedient path in gray areas
- Creates adequate ethical culture but not inspiring or distinctive
- Sometimes rationalizes ethically questionable decisions based on pressure or circumstances
- Ethics are solid in clear-cut cases but judgment wavers in complex situations
- **Example:** "Maintains generally high standards but pushed boundaries on expense reporting when under budget pressure; team noticed inconsistency between stated values and behavior"

**2 - DEVELOPING (Significant Gaps)**
- Ethical standards are inconsistent or unclear
- Tolerates ethical lapses by others when addressing would be inconvenient
- Sometimes makes decisions that prioritize results over integrity
- Others express concerns about their ethical judgment in specific situations
- **Example:** "Knew about quality issues but delayed disclosure because of timing concerns; when problem emerged publicly, damaged trust with customers and team"

**1 - NOT DEMONSTRATED (Not Ready)**
- Serious ethical concerns or breaches in judgment
- Creates culture where ethics take back seat to results
- Has violated trust or integrity in ways that damaged relationships or organization
- Others question their ethical standards or trustworthiness fundamentally
- **Example:** "Made misleading statements to board about business performance; when discovered, several board members resigned; family is questioning whether they should remain in leadership"

## RATING CALIBRATION GUIDE

### How to Use These Behavioral Anchors

**Step 1: Read the competency definition and all five levels**

**Step 2: Identify which level most closely matches your observations**
- Look for the description that best fits majority of behaviors you've observed
- One or two examples at a level is suggestive; consistent pattern is more definitive

**Step 3: Consider body of evidence over time**
- Recent behavior (last 12 months) most relevant
- Look for patterns, not isolated incidents
- High-stakes situations often reveal true capability

**Step 4: Use half-steps if needed**
- 3.5 = "Between adequate and strong" 
- 4.5 = "Between strong and exceptional"
- System allows decimal ratings for nuance

**Step 5: "Unable to Assess" is valid**
- If you haven't observed behavior in this competency area
- If your interaction has been too limited for confident assessment
- Being honest about limited visibility helps data quality

### Common Rating Errors to Avoid

❌ **Halo Effect:** Rating all competencies high because of overall positive impression
❌ **Horns Effect:** Rating all competencies low because of one negative experience  
❌ **Central Tendency:** Giving everyone 3s to avoid being too positive or negative
❌ **Recency Bias:** Letting most recent interaction override long-term pattern
❌ **Leniency Bias:** Rating higher than deserved to avoid conflict or maintain relationships
❌ **Comparison Bias:** Rating relative to other candidates rather than role requirements

### Tips for Accurate Assessment

✅ **Base ratings on observed behavior, not potential or personality**
✅ **Consider: What would someone need to demonstrate to be ready for CEO role?**
✅ **Use specific examples to support your ratings**
✅ **Be honest but constructive in comments**
✅ **Remember: This is for development, not judgment**
✅ **Your thoughtful feedback is a gift to help them grow**
