**2 - DEVELOPING (Significant Gaps)**
- Ethical standards are inconsistent or situational
- Board hasn't established clear ethical expectations or oversight
- Tolerates ethical lapses when addressing would be difficult
- Stakeholders question board commitment to ethical oversight
- **Example:** "Board aware of aggressive accounting practices but didn't intervene; family employment decisions favor relatives despite qualification concerns; independent directors uncomfortable with ethical climate"

**1 - NOT DEMONSTRATED (Not Ready)**
- Serious ethical concerns with board decisions or oversight
- Board enabled or covered up ethical violations
- Integrity questions have damaged organizational or board reputation
- Stakeholders have lost trust in board's ethical leadership
- **Example:** "Board approved related party transaction benefiting chair's personal investments; investigation revealed board knew of regulatory violations but took no action; multiple directors face personal liability; company reputation severely damaged"

## RATING CALIBRATION GUIDE

### Board Chair vs. CEO Assessment

**Key Differences:**

| Dimension | Board Chair | CEO |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| **Primary Role** | Governance oversight | Operational execution |
| **Time Horizon** | Long-term (5-10 years) | Short & long-term balance |
| **Decision Authority** | Facilitative, consensus-building | Direct decision-making |
| **Relationships** | Board, shareholders, CEO | Management team, employees |
| **Success Metric** | Board effectiveness, governance quality | Business performance, results |
| **Skills Emphasis** | Facilitation, oversight, process | Vision, execution, leadership |

**Board Chair candidates should be rated on:**
- ✅ Governance expertise, not operational skills
- ✅ Facilitation ability, not directive leadership
- ✅ Strategic oversight, not strategic execution
- ✅ Board development, not team development
- ✅ Fiduciary mindset, not entrepreneurial mindset

### When to Use "Unable to Assess"

**Appropriate situations:**
- You haven't observed board-level interactions
- Limited exposure to governance scenarios
- Competency requires board membership to assess fairly
- Your role (e.g., operations) doesn't provide relevant visibility

**Example:** "As direct report, I can assess CEO leadership but not board facilitation skills"

### Rating Philosophy for Board Chair

**Remember:** Board Chair is part-time role requiring different competencies than full-time executive

**Look for:**
- Judgment and wisdom over energy and drive
- Process discipline over charisma
- Long-term thinking over urgency
- Facilitation over direction-setting
- Fiduciary mindset over entrepreneurial risk-taking

**Board Chair at level 4 (Ready) should demonstrate:**
- Solid governance expertise and continuous learning
- Effective meeting facilitation and decision processes
- Strong relationships with independent directors and CEO
- Clear boundaries between family and board roles
- High integrity and ethical leadership

**Not required for Board Chair but valuable:**
- Operational excellence (that's CEO/management)
- Deep functional expertise (rely on management/committees)
- Daily involvement (part-time oversight role)
