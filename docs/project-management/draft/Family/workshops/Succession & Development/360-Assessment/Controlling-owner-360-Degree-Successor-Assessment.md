- Demonstrates 50-100 year thinking about family wealth and legacy preservation
- Makes ownership decisions others describe as "visionary stewardship"
- Balances current generation needs with obligations to unborn generations
- Others describe them as embodying "patient capital" philosophy
- **Example:** "When offered $500M premium to sell family business, led family through deep reflection on mission and legacy; decision to decline was based on multi-generational wealth creation potential and family purpose; 10 years later, business worth $2B and family unity stronger than ever"

**4 - STRONG (Ready for Controlling Owner)**
- Consistently demonstrates 20-30 year time horizon in ownership decisions
- Resists short-term pressures that would compromise long-term family wealth
- Understands difference between owner returns and management performance
- Makes patient capital allocation decisions family trusts
- **Example:** "During recession, resisted pressure to cut R&D despite short-term earnings impact; explained to family: 'We're building for grandchildren, not next quarter'; decision preserved innovation capability and competitive position; family appreciated long-term thinking"

- Intellectually understands long-term ownership but emotionally pulls toward short-term
- Time horizon is 5-10 years rather than generational
- Sometimes confuses owner perspective with manager or investor perspective

**2 - DEVELOPING (Significant Gaps)**
- Primarily short-term oriented (3-5 years); limited generational thinking
- Makes ownership decisions based on current generation preferences without considering future
- Treats family wealth as investment portfolio rather than stewardship responsibility
- Family questions whether they understand ownership vs. investment mentality

**1 - NOT DEMONSTRATED (Not Ready)**
- Demonstrates investor mentality, not ownership stewardship
- No evidence of generational thinking or legacy preservation concern
- Makes decisions that optimize personal benefit over family long-term wealth
- Family fears they would liquidate or mismanage generational wealth

- Understands diversification, risk management, and tax implications
- Makes sound wealth allocation decisions balancing growth and preservation

**2 - DEVELOPING (Significant Gaps)**
- Limited understanding of wealth preservation principles
- Poor wealth allocation decisions or excessive concentration
- Missed major opportunities or exposed wealth to unnecessary risks

- **Example:** "Developed 'Family Capital Charter' defining allocation philosophy: 50% business growth, 25% diversification, 15% liquidity, 10% philanthropy; over 15 years, disciplined allocation grew family wealth 4x industry benchmarks; multiple family offices now use framework"

**4 - STRONG (Ready for Controlling Owner)**
- Sound capital allocation decisions with clear strategic rationale
- Balances competing capital needs (growth, diversification, liquidity) effectively
- Investment decisions are disciplined and patient
- Track record shows good returns and appropriate risk management

- Tendency toward either excessive risk or excessive conservatism
- Unable to balance competing capital priorities effectively

- No coherent investment philosophy or discipline
- Decisions driven by emotion or personal interest rather than family wealth optimization
- Family wealth has declined under their influence on capital decisions

- Communicates clearly about reinvestment rationale and dividend philosophy
- Creates mechanisms for family members to access liquidity when truly needed
- Both business and family stakeholders are reasonably satisfied

**3 - ADEQUATE (Needs Development)**
- Balance exists but tension is evident and not fully resolved
- Business or family feels shortchanged in capital allocation
- Liquidity mechanisms are inadequate or business reinvestment is insufficient

**2 - DEVELOPING (Significant Gaps)**

- Or family trapped with no access to wealth while business over-capitalizes
- Crisis imminent due to inability to balance these needs

## RATING CALIBRATION GUIDE

### Controlling Owner vs. CEO vs. Board Chair

**Key Distinctions:**

| Dimension | Controlling Owner | CEO | Board Chair |
|-----------|------------------|-----|-------------|
| **Primary Role** | Ownership stewardship | Operations execution | Governance oversight |
| **Authority** | Ultimate (subject to law) | Delegated by board | Facilitates board authority |
| **Time Horizon** | 50-100 years (generational) | 5-10 years | 10-20 years |
| **Key Stakeholders** | Family, future generations | Management team, employees | Board, CEO, shareholders |
| **Success Metric** | Generational wealth + family unity | Business performance | Board effectiveness |
| **Decision Style** | Patient, long-term, values-driven | Strategic + operational | Oversight, facilitating consensus |
| **Primary Concern** | Family legacy and wealth preservation | Business results | Governance quality |

**Controlling Owner candidates should be rated on:**
- ✅ Stewardship mindset, not growth-at-all-costs
- ✅ Family unity preservation, not just business value
- ✅ Generational thinking, not quarterly/annual performance
- ✅ Values and legacy, not just financial returns
- ✅ Owner perspective, not manager or investor perspective

### Understanding "Owner" vs. "Manager" vs. "Investor"

**Owner Mindset:**
- This wealth is entrusted to me for future generations
- My job is to grow AND preserve family capital and unity
- I balance financial returns with family cohesion and values
- I make decisions as steward, not as portfolio manager

**Manager Mindset (not appropriate for owner):**
- Focus on operational execution and efficiency
- Short-term performance metrics
- Professional achievement

**Investor Mindset (not appropriate for owner):**
- Maximize financial returns above all else
- Portfolio diversification and risk-adjusted returns
- Would sell if returns disappoint

### When to Use "Unable to Assess"

**Appropriate situations:**
- You haven't observed ownership-level decisions
- Limited visibility into family dynamics or wealth management
- Don't know their relationship with next generation
- Your interaction is professional/transactional, not ownership context

**Example:** "As external advisor, I can assess judgment and communication but not family unity or next generation development"

### Rating Philosophy for Controlling Owner

**Remember:** This is most consequential role in family business—gets ultimate say on major ownership questions

**Look for:**
- **Long-term thinking** (decades, not years)
- **Family stewardship** (not personal benefit maximization)
- **Wisdom and judgment** (not just intelligence)
- **Humility** (will seek counsel and empower others)
- **Unifying presence** (brings family together, not divides)
- **Values alignment** (decisions consistent with family mission)

**Controlling Owner at level 4 (Ready) should demonstrate:**
- Generational time horizon in ownership thinking
- Strong family relationships across all branches
- Sound judgment on complex family and wealth matters
- Active next generation development
- Balance of family needs with wealth preservation
- Humility to seek expertise and empower others

**Critical difference from CEO/Board Chair:**
- CEO is hired (can be replaced if performance falters)
- Board Chair facilitates (doesn't make unilateral decisions)
- Controlling Owner has ultimate authority AND lifetime tenure
- Mistakes are much harder to fix
- **Bar should be higher—this role deserves extra scrutiny**
